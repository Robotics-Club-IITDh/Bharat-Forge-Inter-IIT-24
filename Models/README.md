# Model

1. actor.py: Actor and Critic Network used in TD3 Algorithm
2. agent.py: TD3 Algorithm implementation and environment warehouse
3. reward.py: Application related to the Reward
4. noname.py: Main implementation of all actor.py, agent.py and ReplayBuffer application
5. ppo_model : An alternate for actor.py
6. ppo_model.pth : saved weights of ppo_model.py which will be ideally used for training on ROS2 setup
